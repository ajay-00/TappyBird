# TappyBird
FlappyBird Remade using unity in C#

This was a personal project used to learn more about game development and practice coding in C#. 

(f)TappyBird is a simple game where you tap the screen to make a bird fly and guide through a series of tubes. 


All of the graphics (not including the twitter bird) were made by me. Feel free to use them if you would like.
